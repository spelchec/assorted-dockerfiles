# Purpose
This project is a dumping ground for assorted Docker projects that will be available on Docker Hub. Some of these are more test cases than anything else.

# Examples
* [JceLook](./Jce) is a small project meant to check what JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) providers were included in Java (6, but you can change the base image).
